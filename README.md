- 👋 Hi, I’m @SouthBaroness, Manui or Gabi for short.

- 👀 I’m interested in History, Militarism, Social, Literature, 
 Mechanics, Physics, Electronics and well... Computers in general. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cobol, Networking, API and Data dev and analysis.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help, really. 

- 📫 Just use Git, please.
  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her. But I don't care much.

- ⚡ Fun fact: the human thumb is called Polex in the hand,
Halex on the feet. It's a medical terminology. 

- 💀 Yeah... Standard read me file, what a surprise.

- 🗺️ I speak Portuguese and English, but I can understand Spanish and German as well. 
I'm also a writer on my free time.
